🗓️ Custom Event Calendar
A dynamic and interactive custom event calendar built with React, offering comprehensive event management capabilities including creation, editing, recurrence, and drag-and-drop scheduling, all while actively preventing scheduling conflicts. This application is designed to help users organize their time efficiently and manage their appointments with ease.

✨ Features
❖Intuitive Event Creation:
    •Easily add new events with a user-friendly form.
    •Define essential details like title, date, time, description, color, and recurrence patterns.
❖Seamless Event Editing:
    •Click on any existing event directly on the calendar to open it in an edit mode.
    •Quickly modify its details, including title, date, time, description, recurrence, and color.
❖Robust Recurrence Options:
    •Set events to repeat on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
    •The calendar intelligently generates and manages recurring instances based on your chosen pattern.
    Editing a recurring event's base instance automatically updates all its future occurrences.
❖Interactive Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:
    •Effortlessly reschedule events by dragging them from one day cell to another.
    •When a recurring event is moved, all its future instances automatically adjust to maintain the schedule relative to the new start date.
❖Proactive Conflict Management:
    •Includes robust logic to detect and prevent overlapping events based on their date and time.
    •Users are alerted if a new event (or any of its recurring instances) conflicts with an existing event.
    •This ensures a clean, organized, and conflict-free schedule, preventing double-bookings.
❖Local Storage Persistence:
    •All your events are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.
    •Your schedule remains intact even after closing and reopening the browser, providing a consistent user experience.
❖ Event Colors:
    •Assign distinct colors to your events for quick visual identification.
    •Enhances organization and allows for easy categorization of different event types.

🚀 Technologies Used:
•React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, forming the core of the application.
•date-fns: A modern JavaScript date utility library, used for efficient and reliable date manipulation and formatting.
•HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring the content and providing a clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing design.
